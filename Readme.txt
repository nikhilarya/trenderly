Trenderly.py

The script collects public data from facebook newsfeed pages across different demo pages . The data collected is added to database, post formatting it into a CSV format. The data is compared with each other through the algorithm of "Comparison.cpp" . If the matching factor of any two newsfeeds is about 30% the news is marked as trending and stored in a new table .

The refined data is later accessed by the web application.
